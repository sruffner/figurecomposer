# Changelog

**FigureComposer** development began in Dec 2003 and the first useful version (1.0.1) was released in Dec 2006.
Other major version releases came in Jul 2007 (2.0), May 2008 (3.0), Jan 2013 (4.0), and Apr 2016 (5.0). Originally 
named after and based upon Stephen G. Lisberger's **Phyplot** application, it was for many years part of the larger
**DataNav** application suite, which intended to provide a mechanism for archiving and sharing experimental 
neuroscience data sets. **DataNav** was ultimately abandoned, and **FigureComposer** has been a standalone application 
since Nov 2017 (5.1).

This file documents changes in the **FigureComposer** code base since it was moved to a GitHub repository in June 
2024, after version 5.4.5 was released. A complete version history is 
[available](https://sites.google.com/a/srscicomp.com/figure-composer/version-history) on the **FigureComposer** website.

## v5.4.6 (19 Jun 2024)
- Created figurecomposer IntelliJ IDEA project with figurecomposer and common modules, copying all code, resource and 
supporting files from original Eclipse projects.
- Extensive minor changes throughout code base to make JDK11-compliant and fix all issues identified by IntelliJ IDEA.
