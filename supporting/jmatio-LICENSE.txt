FigureComposer makes use of a modified version of the JMatIO Library by Wojciech Gradkowski. The
modified version lacks the ability to write MAT files, skips over any Matlab function handles
and Matlab arrays of the "opaque" class. It also contains a number of fixes to issues encountered
while trying to reading in Matlab FIG files (which are really just special MAT files).
